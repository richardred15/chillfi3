- Use `touch-action: manipulation` for better touch response

- Ensure proper z-index layering for overlapping elements
- Use `pointer-events: none` for invisible elements that shouldn't block interaction
- **Custom Scrollbars**: 8px width with glass border styling and hover effects

- **DOM Batching**: 10ms delays between DOM updates for smooth rendering
- **CLS Prevention**: Min-height on sections to prevent layout shifts
